# Snow-Crash Project: Introduction to Computer Security

## Overview
**Snow-Crash** is an educational project designed to introduce learners to the field of computer security. It adopts a developer-oriented approach, allowing participants to explore various security sub-domains. The project is structured to enhance familiarity with multiple programming languages such as ASM, Perl, PHP, etc., and to develop a logical mindset for understanding unfamiliar programs. A key focus is on recognizing and addressing vulnerabilities arising from simple programming errors.

## Project Structure
The project consists of 14 levels, each presenting a unique security challenge. Successful exploitation of a security breach in one level grants access to the subsequent level.

### Two-Part Division
- **Mandatory Levels:** Levels 00 to 09
- **Bonus Levels:** Levels 10 to 14

Each level is organized into folder, comprising two main components:
1. **Resources:** Essential materials and guides.
2. **Flag:** The flag to gain level privilege.

### Technical Requirement
- **Use of Virtual Machine:** It is required to use a virtual machine throughout the project for practical exercises.
