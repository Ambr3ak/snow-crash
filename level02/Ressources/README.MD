### Vulnerability Assessment

The assessment starts with an examination of the home directory, where a PCAP (Packet Capture) file is discovered:

```bash
$ ls -l
total 12
----r--r-- 1 flag02 level02 8302 Aug 30  2015 level02.pcap
```

A PCAP file records network packet data and is typically created by network sniffing tools like tcpdump or Wireshark. It's invaluable for network analysis, troubleshooting, and security investigations, providing a detailed snapshot of network activities.

### Exploitation

To analyze the PCAP file, it must first be transferred to a local system using the `scp` command:

```jsx
scp -P 4242 level02@192.168.56.101:level02.pcap .
```

After ensuring proper permissions, the file can be opened with Wireshark for analysis.

The analysis process involves:

1. Opening Wireshark.
2. Navigating to `Analyze → Follow → TCP Stream` to inspect the packet contents.

This in-depth examination of the TCP stream within the PCAP file reveals critical information, leading to the discovery of the next password: `ft_wandr 7f 7f 7f NDRel 7f L0L`.

The password, when interpreted correctly, is `ft_waNDReL0L`.

```bash
$ su flag02 -> ft_waNDReL0L
$ getflag
