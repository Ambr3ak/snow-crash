### Vulnerability Assessment

Use the `find` command to search for files with `flag00` group permissions:

```jsx
find / -group flag00 2> /dev/null
```

1. `find /` - Starts the `find` command to search for files within the directory hierarchy, beginning from the root directory `/`, covering the entire filesystem.
2. `group flag00` - This option filters the search to include only files belonging to the group `flag00`. In Unix/Linux, each file is associated with an owner and a group, and this option ensures the search results are limited to those files whose group ownership is `flag00`.
3. `2> /dev/null` - Manages error handling. In Unix/Linux, outputs and errors are directed to different streams. `2` represents the standard error stream (stderr). The `>` is a redirection operator, and `/dev/null` is a special file that discards all data written to it. Thus, `2> /dev/null` redirects all error messages (like "permission denied") to `/dev/null`, effectively suppressing them.

### Exploitation

```bash
$ find / -group flag00 2> /dev/null
/usr/sbin/john
/rofs/usr/sbin/john
$ cat /usr/sbin/john

```

Next, decode the output using tools like [dCode](https://www.dcode.fr/identification-chiffrement). It's identified as a ROT encryption. ROT13, which stands for "rotate by 13 places", is a simple substitution cipher that shifts a letter 13 places down the alphabet. It's a symmetrical encryption algorithm providing minimal cryptographic security and is easily deciphered. The ROT13 algorithm is implemented by shifting the ASCII code of a letter by 13.

```bash
$ su flag00 -> nottoohardhere
$ getflag
